# Getting started with Shunt

This guide contains everything you need to make the most out of Shunt.

For anything not explained here, try the **FAQ** and **Support** sections at [https://my.shunt.io/](https://my.shunt.io/)


## Basic usage

- Any files copied into this site's Dropbox folder will automatically appear in your Shunt site.

- Try putting some files and folders in the site's Dropbox folder. They should appear on the Shunt site as soon as they've finished syncing.
 
- **IMPORTANT:** If you move the site folder within your Dropbox, make sure to update the site folder path in your site settings at [https://my.shunt.io/](https://my.shunt.io/)


## Changing the order of your files

- The order that files appear in is determined by their filename.

- If a filename starts with a number (e.g. `01 Invoice.pdf`), this number will be used to determine the file ordering.

- File ordering numbers won't be shown in the Shunt site.


## Categorising your files

- Files can be categorised into groups.

- To create a file group, just make a new folder in your site folder and put files inside it.

- File groups are ordered by their folder name, just like the file ordering.

- File groups can contain sub-groups that are used to filter within a file group.

- To create a sub-group, just make a new folder inside the file group folder and put files inside it.

- Sub-groups are ordered by their folder name, just like the file ordering.

- **IMPORTANT:** Any files nested deeper than the sub-group level will not show up in the site.


## Collaborating with others
