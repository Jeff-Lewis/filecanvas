# Getting started with Shunt

---

- Any files copied into this site's Dropbox folder will automatically appear in your Shunt site.

- You can share the site's Dropbox folder with other Dropbox users to allow them to collaborate on your Shunt site.
 
- If you move the site's folder within your Dropbox, make sure to update the site folder path in your site settings.

- Try putting some files and folders in the site's Dropbox folder. You should be able to see them on the Shunt site as soon as they've finished syncing.

- Now you've got the hang of Shunt, it's time to delete this file and start building your Shunt site!
